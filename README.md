# Hospitals.CSV Analysis

This is the final project for the PROPEL Statistics course for Rachael Schmidt and Stacy de Florencio.

The dataset used for analysis and for this repository is from the CORGIS 
Datasets Project, by Austin Cory Bart, Ryan Whitcomb, Jason Riddle, Omar Saleem,
Dr. Eli Tilevich, Dr. Clifford A. Shaffer, and Dr. Dennis Kafura:

Bart, A. et al. CORGIS: The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated
Datasets. https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/.

The dataset specifically is specifically by Dennis Kafura:

## Description

The dataset contains the following keys for many Medicare-qualified hospitals in
the US and was released to the public to enable consumers to make informed 
decisions about where to seek healthcare:

- Facility Name
- Facility City
- Facility State
- Facility Type
- Rating: Overall
- Rating: Mortality
- Rating: Safety
- Rating: Readmission
- Rating: Experience
- Rating: Effectiveness
- Rating: Timeliness
- Rating: Imaging
- Procedure Cost: Heart Attack
- Procedure Quality: Heart Attack
- Procedure Value: Heart Attack
- Procedure Cost: Heart Failure
- Procedure Quality: Heart Failure
- Procedure Value: Heart Failure
- Procedure Cost: Pneumonia
- Procedure Quality: Pneumonia
- Procedure Value: Pneumonia
- Procedure Cost: Hip-Knee
- Procedure Quality: Hip-Knee
- Procedure Value: Hip-Knee

In the following data analyses, we primarily focus on the overall ratings of 
hospitals in San Francisco, California, and US. We also compare the cost of
hip-knee procedures within San Francisco, the mean cost of this procedure 
depending on the type of medical facility, and the mean cost depending on the
state the hospital is located in.

## References

We primarily referenced the R Graph Gallery by Yan Holtz for formatting the
visualization of the data:

Additionally, we referenced old work from our previous statistics classes that
focused on data visualization and analysis in R.
